# hello-world
## just another repository
### testing in 2021

this is a readme for eltejano (aka kenneth) - it should be a descriptive text for the future

if you need to contact me find this username on twitter

I haven't needed to use github in a while, but broke a laptop and wanted to fix the text editor I was using, well... re-install the editor and check the github credentials.
